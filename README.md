# Web Chat App 

This simple Web Chat App is a personal project with the intent to learn Node.js, React and MongoDB.

The Web Chat App is pretty simple. The user will be requested with just a nickname to join the room and can start chatting right away.
Multiple users are allowed to join to the same chat and all the messages can be seem by all chat users.


Upcoming features:
- Save chat history on MongoDB.
- Load the history of the conversation on the chat to a new user.
- Log off button.
- Keep user nickname and session if the user logs out without hitting the log off button.
- Random nickname generator when the user doesn't want to create one.

Some of the tools and frameworks for faster and better coding:

- Material UI: for front-end components
- Socket.IO: for a socket protocol communication between client and server
- Parcel Bundler: web application bundler for easier configuration and faster compilation
- Babel: JS compiler to convert ES2015+ code syntax to older browsers and environments
